# Tutorial 7
## Q1
### Explain the difference between pass by value and pass by address in parameter
passing.
```
Ans:
Pass by value gives a copy of the variable itself. Pass by address gives a copy
of the address pointing to the variable to the function.
```
Local variables passed by value will be destroyed after the function ends. Local
variables passed by address are not destroyed after the function ends.

## Q3
### a
`void func1(int b, int c);`

### a(ii)
`a = 5, b = 2`
